# DBMS-Star-Scheme

<b>Project Description</b>  
The annual report of car accidents in the United Kingdom was given to us in a text file. 
Our goal was to load the data in the Microsoft SQL Server in the appropriate form and then
restructure the database into a Data Warehouse using the Star Scheme Method. Closing, we were
asked to perform various sql queries, taking advantage of the star scheme, in order to extract
valuable information from the database.
